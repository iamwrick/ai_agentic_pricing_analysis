> Agentic Pricing Analysis is a cutting-edge solution that leverages multiple advanced technologies to automate and optimize pricing strategies for businesses. This project combines the power of CrewAI, OpenAI models, TavilySearch, and LangChain to provide intelligent, real-time pricing comparisons across various industries. It helps businesses dynamically adjust their pricing based on competitor movements, market trends, and other relevant data sources.

## Key features:

- Real-time Pricing Comparisons: Automatically gather and compare pricing data from various sources to identify competitive pricing strategies.
- AI-Powered Analysis: Use OpenAI models to understand and analyze complex pricing patterns and trends.
- Dynamic Data Sourcing: Integrates TavilySearch to fetch relevant data from diverse online platforms, including competitors' websites and market reports.
- Advanced Language Processing: LangChain enhances the system's ability to process and interpret both structured and unstructured data, including web scraping, news articles, and social media discussions.

> This system is designed to showcase how businesses can make smarter pricing decisions, anticipate competitor actions, and adjust their strategies for maximum profitability using Agentic workflows.

## Technologies used:

- CrewAI: For intelligent task automation and agent-driven analysis.
- OpenAI Models: For natural language understanding and advanced data processing.
- TavilySearch: For real-time market and competitor data scraping.
- LangChain: For enhancing the NLP pipeline, enabling sophisticated data extraction and analysis.

## Setup:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

`git clone https://github.com/iamwrick/ai_agentic_pricing_analysis.git`

2. Navigate to the project directory:

`cd ai_agentic_pricing_analysis`

3. Install the package and its dependencies:

`pip install .`
This will install the ai_agentic_pricing_analysis package and all of its dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file.

4. Create a .env file: In the project root directory, create a .env file to store your API keys. Add the following lines to the .env file:
`OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_api_key_here`
Make sure to replace your_openai_api_key_here and your_tavily_api_key_here with your actual API keys. 
Note: The .env file is used to securely store environment variables, and it should not be committed to the repository. Ensure that it is added to .gitignore to prevent accidental exposure of your keys.

5. Optional - Set up the development environment: If you want to set up the project for development, you can install the development dependencies as follows:
`pip install .[dev]`
